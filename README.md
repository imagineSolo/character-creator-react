## Description

This is a new, fresh approach on my first project - the Fantasy Character Creator for an RPG game.
Create a character by making step by step choices. Save your character when you've finished. Preview saved characters.

I've learned a lot while working on this application.

## Technologies

- SCSS (with CSS modules)
